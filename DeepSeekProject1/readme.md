# Notes CLI

This is a simple command-line tool written in Go that allows you to create, view, edit, and delete notes, stored in a file.

## Installation

To install the tool, you will need to have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: <https://golang.org/dl/>

Once you have Go installed, you can clone the repository and build the tool:
```
go build note.go
```
This will create an executable file named `note` in the current directory.

## Usage

To use the tool, you can run the `note` command followed by one of the following subcommands:

* `add [note]` - adds a new note to the notes file
* `view` - displays all notes in the file
* `edit [old note] [new note]` - replaces an existing note with a new note
* `delete [note]` - removes a note from the file

For example, to add a new note, you can run:
```
./note add "This is a note"
```
To view all notes, you can run:
```
./note view
```
To edit a note, you can run:
```
./note edit "This is an old note" "This is a new note"
```
To delete a note, you can run:
```
./note delete "This is a note to delete"
```
